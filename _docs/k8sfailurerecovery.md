If a host enters reconnecting/disconnected state, attempt to re-run the agent registration command. Wait 3 minutes. If the host hasnâ€™t re-entered active state, add a new host with similar resources and host labels. Delete the old host from the environment. Containers will be scheduled to the new host and eventually become healthy.
